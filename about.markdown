## Career Overview

I'm an Alaska-based science writer, web manager and destination marketing specialist. 

### Science Writer

As a writer, I cover travel and events in Alaska, science, wildlife biology, paleontology, archaeology, ancient history and technology. My writing portfolio is available on [MuckRack](https://muckrack.com/keenan-britt-1).

I chose to pursue science journalism because of my lifelong passion for science, inspired by my childhood fascination with dinosaurs. I'm currently a board member for the Alaska Museum of Science and Nature. 

I earned a bachelor's degree in anthropology from the University of Michigan and have training in labratory and field methods in both archaeology and paleontology. I participated in archaeological excavations in Belize, Jordan and Alaska. Recently, I visited and [reported on the ongoing excavations at the Carpenter Site](https://www.uaa.alaska.edu/news/archive/2025/07/archaeology-carpenter-site-old-can-artifact.cshtml) near Delta Junction, Alaska. 

### Destination Marketing

I have a robust background in Alaska's travel industry. I lead national level marketing efforts for Valdez, Alaska during my time with Discover Valdez (the Valdez Convention and Visitors Bureau). As part of that role, I served as the web manager for [ValdezAlaska.org](https://www.valdezalaska.org/), during which time I embarked on an ambitious project of greatly increasing the website's content and SEO reach.

 I have assisted in digital marketing efforts for many businesses in the Alaska tourism sector, including travel agencies and tour operators. I've also served Alaska travelers directly, through my work with visitors centers, museums, local theatre and as a tour guide. 

 I represented Valdez, Alaska at professional conferences and events in the Lower 48, including the Alaska Media Roadshow, the Pacific Northwest Sportsmen's Show and the American Bus Association.
