# Hello

I'm an Alaska-based science writer, web manager and destination marketing specialist. 

As a writer I cover travel and events in Alaska, science, wildlife, paleontology, archaeology, ancient history and technology. My writing portfolio is available on [MuckRack](https://muckrack.com/keenan-britt-1).
