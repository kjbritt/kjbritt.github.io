Writing quality meta descriptions for your web pages is a key feature of search engine optimization. 

## What are meta descriptions?

Meta descriptions are short "blurbs" or "snippets" describing the content of your web page. Ideally, these descriptions should be about 150 to 160 charactes in length. 

From Google

>Google will sometimes use the `<meta name="description">` tag from a page to generate a snippet in search results, if we think it gives users a more accurate description than would be possible purely from the on-page content. A meta description tag generally informs and interests users with a short, relevant summary of what a particular page is about. They are like a pitch that convince the user that the page is exactly what they're looking for.

You can easily find a web page's meta description (if it has one) by viewing the page's source code. If you're using a modern browser like Chrome or Firefox on a PC, you can hit Ctrl + U (or right-click and select "View Page Source") while visiting a web page. The code will look something like `<meta name="description" content="Gallia est omnis divisia in partes tres.">`. Can you find the meta description for this post?
