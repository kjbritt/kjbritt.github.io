Writing quality meta descriptions for your web pages is a key feature of search engine optimization (SEO). 

## What are meta descriptions?

Meta descriptions are short "blurbs" or "snippets" describing the content of your web page. Ideally, these descriptions should be about 150 to 160 charactes in length. Though not guranteed, search engines like Google may display a web page's meta description on a search engine results page (SERP).

As Google explained in the article "[Control your snippet in search results](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/snippet)":

>Google will sometimes use the `<meta name="description">` tag from a page to generate a snippet in search results, if we think it gives users a more accurate description than would be possible purely from the on-page content. A meta description tag generally informs and interests users with a short, relevant summary of what a particular page is about. They are like a pitch that convince the user that the page is exactly what they're looking for.

You can easily find a web page's meta description (if it has one) by viewing the page's source code. If you're using a modern browser like Chrome or Firefox on a PC, you can hit Ctrl + U (or right-click and select "View Page Source") while visiting the web page. The HTML code for the meta description will look something like this: `<meta name="description" content="Gallia est omnis divisia in partes tres.">`. Can you find the meta description for this post?

## Why are meta descriptions important for SEO?

Meta descriptions are not considered to be a ranking factor in search engine algorithms like titles, headings and page content. However, well-written meta descriptions can still improve your SEO and drive visitors to your web page. The meta description is your "pitch" to your potential customers as they scroll through the SERP. 

As [Yoast explains](https://yoast.com/meta-descriptions/):

>Google uses click-through rate (CTR) to determine whether you’re a good result. If more people click on your result, Google considers you to be a good result and will, based on your position, move you up the rankings. 

SEO efforts should always, ultimately, be aimed at humans, not bots. You'll want to periodically review your web pages' meta descriptions to ensure they are accurate and up-to-date. Overtime, meta descriptions may become dated, containing references to products or services your organization no longer offers. They may also use old branding language that no longer reflects your brand identity. As you edit or rewrite your meta descriptions, make sure to follow Google's guidelines on "[best practices for creating quality meta descriptions](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/snippet#meta-descriptions)".

## How to automatically pull meta descriptions from every page on your website

If you've taken over management of a website with a significant number of pages, navigating through a CMS to manually review the meta description for each page can take a significant amount of time.
