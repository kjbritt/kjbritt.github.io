Is pollution from space debris endangering our atmosphere? 

Just over a year ago, during the early morning hours of Feb. 19, 2025, a disintegrating fireball blazed across the dark skies over Europe. The fireball wasn't a meteor, nor was it a UFO. The object was identifed as a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket burning up during re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. According to [reporting from the BBC at the time](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62z3vxjplpo), the rocket was sighted over the UK, Sweden and Denmark before "pieces of the rocket then crashed into Poland."

"Lithium was selected as the initial target metal for detecting space
debris signatures due to its ultra-trace abundance in chondritic meteoroids4
and its well-documented applications in spacecraft, including lithium-ion
batteries and lithium-aluminium (Li-Al) alloy hull plating"
