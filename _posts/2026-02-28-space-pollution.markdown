Just over a year ago, during the early morning hours of Feb. 19, 2025, a disintegrating fireball blazed across the dark skies over Europe. The fireball wasn't a meteor, nor was it a UFO. The object was identifed as a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket burning up during re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. According to [reporting from the BBC at the time](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62z3vxjplpo), the rocket was sighted over the UK, Sweden and Denmark before "pieces of the rocket then crashed into Poland."

As rocket launches and re-entries like these become more common, the threat of debris crashing into human settlements is obvious. But what about the material that doesn't burn up in the atmosphere? Is there another, invisible, threat? According to a recent study, the answer is 'yes'.

In an open access article published this month, <cite><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-03154-8">Measurement of a lithium plume from the uncontrolled re-entry of a Falcon 9 rocket</a></cite>, a group of scientists from the Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the University of Rostock in Germany reported that they had detected heightened levels of lithium in the atmosphere following the rocket's re-entry.

"Lithium was selected as the initial target metal for detecting space
debris signatures due to its ultra-trace abundance in chondritic meteoroids4
and its well-documented applications in spacecraft, including lithium-ion
batteries and lithium-aluminium (Li-Al) alloy hull plating"
