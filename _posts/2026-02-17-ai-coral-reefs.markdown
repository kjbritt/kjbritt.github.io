Located along the seaward side of the Florida Keys, the [Florida Reef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Reef) is the only living barrier reef in the Lower 48. 

Can AI save Florida's coral reefs? A team of environmental and data scientists thinks so. In a paper published in December, titled <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/ae2570"<cite>An explainable machine learning prediction system for early warning of heat stress on Florida’s Coral Reef</cite></a>, the team introduced a machine-learning framework that they argued is capable of "forecasting the onset of moderate coral heat stress at site specific resolution" along the Florida Reef. 

[Marybeth Carmela Arcodia](https://people.miami.edu/profile/5fc103221a3deb9dce777c4cfafa9523), Ph.D., an assistant professor at the University of Miami, was the lead author on the paper, joined by co-authors [Richard Karp](https://coralreeffutures.earth.miami.edu/people/lab-alumni/rich-karp/index.html), Ph.D., also with the University of Miami, and [Elizabeth A. Barnes](https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/profile/elizabeth-a-barnes/), Ph.D., with Boston University. 

"Onsets of moderate heat stress only occurred 11 summers at SandKey,10 summers at Sombrero Reef, and 6 summers at Molasses Reef in the full 40-year dataset"
