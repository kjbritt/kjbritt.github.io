Located along the seaward side of the Florida Keys, the [Florida Reef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Reef) is the only living barrier reef in the Lower 48. The Florida Reef is composed of over 6,000 smaller, individual reefs, and is home to hundreds of species of marine vertebrates and dozens of species of coral. 

Sadly, the Florida Reef, like many reefs around the world, is threatened by rising ocean temperatures due to climate change. Warmer water temperatures may result in <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coral_bleach.html"><dfn>coral bleaching</dfn></a> in which corals expel the algae living in their tissues, leaving the coral white in color. The bleached coral is still alive, but much more likely to die due to disease, starvation or stress. 

Coral bleaching has been a major threat to America's coral reefs. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in 2005 the U.S. "lost half of its coral reefs in the Caribbean in one year due to a massive bleaching event [...] centered around the northern Antilles near the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico."

Can AI save Florida's coral reefs? A team of environmental and data scientists thinks so. In a paper published in December, titled <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/ae2570"><cite>An explainable machine learning prediction system for early warning of heat stress on Florida’s Coral Reef</cite></a>, the team introduced a machine-learning framework that they argued is capable of "forecasting the onset of moderate coral heat stress at site specific resolution" along the Florida Reef. 

[Marybeth Carmela Arcodia](https://people.miami.edu/profile/5fc103221a3deb9dce777c4cfafa9523), Ph.D., an assistant professor at the University of Miami, was the lead author on the paper, joined by co-authors [Richard Karp](https://coralreeffutures.earth.miami.edu/people/lab-alumni/rich-karp/index.html), Ph.D., also with the University of Miami, and [Elizabeth A. Barnes](https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/profile/elizabeth-a-barnes/), Ph.D., with Boston University. 

The study focused on three specific parts of the Florida Reef system: Sand Key, Sombrero Reef and Molasses Reef. The team used a 40 year data set, spanning 1985 to 2024, available online from NOAA's [Coral Reef Watch](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/) website. 

"Onsets of moderate heat stress only occurred 11 summers at SandKey, 10 summers at Sombrero Reef, and 6 summers at Molasses Reef in the full 40-year dataset"
