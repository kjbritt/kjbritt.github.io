Ewan Bondeham, a Ph.D. student at University College London, named and described a new species of extinct, crocodile relatives from the Triassic era based on fossils found in Wales. Bondeham named the new species _Galahadosuchus jonesi_ after his former teacher and a mythic hero from Arthurian legend.

Bondeham was the lead author on a scientific paper pubished in _The Anatomical Record_ earlier this month, <cite><a href="https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.70162">A second species of non-crocodyliform crocodylomorph from the Late Triassic fissure deposits of southwestern UK: Implications for locomotory ecological diversity in Saltoposuchidae</a><cite>.
