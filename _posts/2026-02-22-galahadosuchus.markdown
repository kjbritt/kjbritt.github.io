Ewan Bondeham, a Ph.D. student at University College London, named and described a new species of extinct, crocodile relatives from the Triassic Period based on fossils found in England. Bondeham named the new species _Galahadosuchus jonesi_ after his former teacher and a mythic hero from Arthurian legend.

Bondeham was the lead author on a scientific paper pubished in _The Anatomical Record_ earlier this month, <cite><a href="https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.70162">A second species of non-crocodyliform crocodylomorph from the Late Triassic fissure deposits of southwestern UK: Implications for locomotory ecological diversity in Saltoposuchidae</a><cite>, which described the new species.

Bondeham stated in a LinkedIn post that he named the species _jonesi_ after his former school teacher David Rhys Jones, "in recognition of the inspiration he gave me and many other pupils [...] to pursue our passion for science."

The genus name, _Galahadosuchus_ refers to Sir Galahad, "a knight renowned for his moral uprightness," Bondeham explained in _The Anatomical Record_. Bondeham believes _Galahadosuchus_ walked upright, and the name forms a _double entendre_ as it also "alludes to the upright posture of the taxon". In Arthurian lore, Galahad in famous for finding the Holy Grail in tales like the anonymous _Queste del Saint Graal_ and Sir Thomas Malory's _Le Morte d'Arthur_. 

## Defining a new species

The Triassic Period (252-201 million years ago) was very different time. While often considered part of the Mesozoic "Age of Dinosaurs", most of the iconic dinosaur groups that characterized the later Jurassic and Cretaceous periods had yet to evolve. While some dinosaurs roamed the late Triassic, the era also saw the rise of many weird and wonderful crocodile-like species that are relatives - but not direct ancestors - to the crocodiles and alligators of today. 

Bondeham's description of _Galahadosuchus_ is based off of two fossil slabs found in the Cromhall Quarry in southwestern England. The [first fossil slab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galahadosuchus#/media/File:Galahadosuchus_holotype_hindlimbs.jpg) contained the remains of the creature's backbone and hindlimbs. The [second fossil slab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galahadosuchus#/media/File:Galahadosuchus_forelimb.jpg) contained a forelimb. In order to define _Galahadosuchus_ as a <em>new</em> species, Bondeham had to make the case that the fossil was not the member of a previously known species of Triassic crocodile-relative. 

In many ways, the fossil remains of _Galahadosuchus_ are quite similar to those of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrisuchus">Terrestrisuchus</a></i>, another crocodylomorph from the Late Triassic of England and Wales.
