Ewan Bondeham, a Ph.D. student at University College London, named and described a new species of extinct, crocodile relatives from the Triassic era based on fossils found in Wales. Bondeham named the new species _Galahadosuchus jonesi_ after his former teacher and a mythic hero from Arthurian legend.

Bondeham was the lead author on a scientific paper pubished in _The Anatomical Record_ earlier this month, <cite><a href="https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.70162">A second species of non-crocodyliform crocodylomorph from the Late Triassic fissure deposits of southwestern UK: Implications for locomotory ecological diversity in Saltoposuchidae</a><cite>, which described the new species.

Bondeham stated in a LinkedIn post that he named the species _jonesi_ after his former school teacher David Rhys Jones, "in recognition of the inspiration he gave me and many other pupils [...] to pursue our passion for science."

The genus name, _Galahadosuchus_ refers to Sir Galahad, "a knight renowned for his moral uprightness," Bondeham explained in _The Anatomical Record_. Bondeham believes _Galahadosuchus_ walked upright, and the name forms a _double entendre_ as it also "alludes to the upright posture of the taxon". In Arthurian lore, Galahad in famous for finding the Holy Grail in medieval texts like the anonymous _Queste del Saint Graal_ and Sir Thomas Malory's _Le Morte d'Arthur_. Ironically, while many Arthurian heroes like Arthur, Guinevere and Gawan have origins in Welsh folklore, the character of Galahad is likely a creation of medieval French writers.
