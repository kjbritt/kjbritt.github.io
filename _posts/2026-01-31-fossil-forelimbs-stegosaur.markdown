>"a particularly large and robust individual that appears to represent the largest individual stegosaurid in the Morrison Formation in terms of both linear dimensions and estimated body mass."

Co-author Cary Woodruff described the specimen more succinctly [in a post on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/doublebeam.bsky.social/post/3md6bhqfm2c2w): "One big f-ing stego". 


The Morrison Formation is a sequence of sedimentary rock layers from the Upper (i.e. late) Jurassic Period, roughly 156 to 146 million years ago. Sections of the Morrison Formation can be found across much of the Western United States. 

Many of the most famous dinosaurs in the popular imagination originated in Morrison Formation. These include the terrifying _Allosaurus_, the majestic _Brachiosaurus_ and immensely long _Barosaurus_, [which romaed as far north as Montana](https://kjbritt.github.io/paleontology/2026/01/29/neck-bone-barosaurus.html). 

## Fossil forelimbs

Sadly, it&#x27;s only know from partial forelimbs, but we document a stego that based on limb dimension is ~38% longer than the average stego. Assuming we could generally scale isometrically (don&#x27;t come at me!), that all equals the largest specimen thus far.<br><br><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:c7u2jjcpumcdxcnugft7ubz2/post/3md6bhqfm2c2w?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p>&mdash; Cary Woodruff (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:c7u2jjcpumcdxcnugft7ubz2?ref_src=embed">@doublebeam.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:c7u2jjcpumcdxcnugft7ubz2/post/3md6bhqfm2c2w?ref_src=embed">January 24, 2026 at 4:00 AM</a></blockquote><script async src="https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
