A team of archaeologists recently published on a campsite and mammoth ivory workshop from 14,000 years ago.

The lead author on the paper was [Brian T. Wygal](https://www.adelphi.edu/faculty/profiles/profile.php?PID=0545), Ph.D., professor of anthropology at Adelphi University. Wygal was joined on the paper by co-authors Kathryn E. Krasinski and Lillian Barber, also with Adelphi University, along with Charles E. Holmes and Barbara A. Crass from the Univesity of Alaska Fairbanks.

The archaeological evidence was professionally excavated at the Holzman Site, located along the Shaw Creek in Interior Alaska. The immediate vicinity where the Shaw Creek meets the Tanana River is home to a number of deeply-stratified archaeological sites with cultural layers as far back as the Pleistocene ("Ice Age"), including the Mead, Broken Mammoth and the Carpenter Site.
