In a recent scientific paper, a team of archaeologists published on the discovery of a campsite and an "extensive" mammoth ivory "workshop" from nearly 14,000 years ago in Interior Alaska.

Published in the journal _Quarternary International_ in December, the paper,<cite>Stone and mammoth ivory tool production, circulation, and human dispersals in the middle Tanana Valley, Alaska: Implications for the Pleistocene peopling of the Americas</cite>, is currently [available online for free through Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618225004306). The article's lead author is [Brian T. Wygal](https://www.adelphi.edu/faculty/profiles/profile.php?PID=0545), Ph.D., professor of anthropology at Adelphi University. Wygal was joined on the paper by co-authors Kathryn E. Krasinski and Lillian Barber, also with Adelphi University, along with Charles E. Holmes and Barbara A. Crass from the Univesity of Alaska Fairbanks.

The archaeological evidence originated at the Holzman Site, located along the Shaw Creek in Interior Alaska. The immediate vicinity where the Shaw Creek meets the Tanana River is home to a number of deeply-stratified archaeological sites with cultural layers as far back as the Pleistocene ("Ice Age"), including the Mead, Broken Mammoth and the [Carpenter Site](https://www.uaa.alaska.edu/news/archive/2025/09/ice-age-cooking-carpenter-site.cshtml). The area is approximately a half-hour drive along the Richardson Highway from the town of Delta Junction, Alaska.
