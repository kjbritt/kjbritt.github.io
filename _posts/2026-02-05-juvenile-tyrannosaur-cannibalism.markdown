The Morrison Formation is a sequence of sedimentary rock layers from the Upper (i.e. late) Jurassic Period, roughly 156 to 146 million years ago, found across much of the Western United States. The formation yielded up the fossilized bones of many iconic dinosaur species, including beloved _Stegosaurus_ and the fearsome _Allosaurus_.
