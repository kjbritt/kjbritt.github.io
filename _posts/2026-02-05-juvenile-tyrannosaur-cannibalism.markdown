Paleontologists have debated for decades about whether tyrannosaurus like _Tyrannosaurus rex_ were primarily hunters or scavengers. However, it seems clear that whether they prefered to hunt or scavenge, tyrannosaurs partook in cannibalism. A [study published back in 2010](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013419) argued that large tooth marks left on fossil bones of _Tyrannosaurus rex_ must have been left by another _T.rex_. The authors concluded that "cannibalism seems to have been a surprisingly common behavior in _Tyrannosaurus_, and this behavior may have been relatively common in carnivorous dinosaurs."

A new study, published in _Evolving Earth_ on Jan. 22 reported on new evidence of cannibalism among tyrannosaurus. The full paper is currently [available for free online through Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950117226000038). 

The paper was authored by Josephine Nielsen of Aarhus University. Nielsen was joined on the paper by co-authors Devin Fowler, Ph.D., of the Badlands Dinosaur Museum, Taia Wyenberg-Henzler of the University of Alberta and Christof Pearce, Ph.D., also of Aarhus University.
