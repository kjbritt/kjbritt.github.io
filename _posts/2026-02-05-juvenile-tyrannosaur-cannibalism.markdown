Paleontologists have debated for decades about whether tyrannosaurus like _Tyrannosaurus rex_ were primarily hunters or scavengers. However, it seems clear that whether they prefered to hunt or scavenge, tyrannosaurs partook in cannibalism. A [study published back in 2010](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013419) argued that large tooth marks left on fossil bones of _Tyrannosaurus rex_ must have been left by another _T.rex_. The authors concluded that "cannibalism seems to have been a surprisingly common behavior in _Tyrannosaurus_, and this behavior may have been relatively common in carnivorous dinosaurs."
