Mosasaurs, long imagined as terrifying ocean predators, may have also hunted in freshwater rivers, according to a recent study.

In an article published in December in the academic journal BMC Zoology, titled <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40850-025-00246-y"><cite>“King of the Riverside”, a multi-proxy approach offers a new perspective on mosasaurs before their extinction</cite></a>, paleontologists Melanie A.D. During and Nathan E. Van Vranken and their co-authors argued that "mosasaurs, traditionally considered marine reptiles, could inhabit freshwater 
environments".
