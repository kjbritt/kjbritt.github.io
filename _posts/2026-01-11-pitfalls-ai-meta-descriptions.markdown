I'm a big advocate of automating efforts for search engine optimization (SEO) to save time and sanity. In a recent post, I explained the SEO importance of well-written meta descriptions and how you can [Automate your SEO efforts by scraping meta descriptions](https://kjbritt.github.io/seo/2026/01/04/automate-seo-meta-descriptions.html) with my Python script. 

However, some automation techniques should be approached with caution. I recently experimented with using AI large language models (LLMs) like Google Gemini to automatically generate optimized meta descriptions. Needless to say, the results were mixed.

As Google explained in the article [“Control your snippet in search results”](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/snippet):

>Google will sometimes use the <meta name="description"> tag from a page to generate a snippet in search results, if we think it gives users a more accurate description than would be possible purely from the on-page content. A meta description tag generally informs and interests users with a short, relevant summary of what a particular page is about. They are like a pitch that convince the user that the page is exactly what they’re looking for.
