The [Badlands Dinosaur Museum](https://www.dickinsongov.com/museum-center), located on the campus of the Dickinson Museum Center in Dickinson, North Dakota, is hiring for a seasonal paleontology assistant for the summer. 

## Which dinosaurs made the footprints?

Dinosaur Valley State Park is adorned with two gigantic dinosaur sculptures, _Tyrannosaurus_ and "Brontosaurus". The sculptures were created for the 1964 World's Fair by the Sinclair Oil Corporation and later donated to the park. [According to Texas Parks and Wildlife](https://tpwd.texas.gov/state-parks/dinosaur-valley/dvsp-artifacts/from-dinoland-to-dino-valley), the tyrannosaur model once had a moving animatronic jaw that has sadly been removed. 

But were these the dinosaurs that made the footprints at the park? Definitely not. 

The rock layers at the park that contain the footprints date back to the Early Cretaceous Period, 113 million years ago. This was much too late for Bronto and far too early for T-Rex. 

The consensus is that the tracks are likely from _Sauroposeidon_ (the sauropod) and _Acrocanthosaurus_ (the theropod) which were known to have roamed Texas and the Western United States during the time period.
