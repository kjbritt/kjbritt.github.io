The Morrison Formation is a sequence of sedimentary rock layers from the Upper (i.e. late) Jurassic Period, roughly 156 to 146 million years ago, found across much of the Western United States. The formation yielded up the fossilized bones of many iconic dinosaur species, including beloved _Stegosaurus_ and my personal favorite, _Allosaurus_. 

The Morrison Formation is notable for being home to _many_ species of sauropods - the herbivorous "long-neck" dinosaurs. The Morrison sauropods include dinosaur super-stars like _Brachiosaurus_ and _Apatosaurus_ (the artist formerly known as "Brontosaurus"), as well as an ensemble cast of B-list celebs like _Diplodocus_ and _Camarasaurus_. 

One Morrison Formation sauropod, _Barosaurus lenti_, is known from fossil finds across several states, including Wyoming, Utah, Oklahoma and South Dakota. Until now

Skye Walker:
That's a fair interpretation! With the key caveat here being that in the paper, we treat this as a POSSIBLE ecological signal rather than a definitive conclusion.
The ID of Barosaurus in Montana adds another data point to a broader pattern in the northern Morrison, where diplodocids seem to be more common than macronarians. But we do note that this pattern could reflect a combination of ecological differences, sampling bias, or both!
