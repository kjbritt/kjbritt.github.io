The Morrison Formation is a sequence of sedimentary rock layers from the Upper (i.e. late) Jurassic Period, roughly 156 to 146 million years ago, found across much of the Western United States. The formation yielded up the fossilized bones of many iconic dinosaur species, including beloved _Stegosaurus_ and the fearsome _Allosaurus_. 

The Morrison Formation is also notable for being home to _many_ species of sauropods - the herbivorous "long-neck" dinosaurs. The Morrison Formation includes sauropod super-stars like _Brachiosaurus_ and _Apatosaurus_ (the artist formerly known as "Brontosaurus"), as well as an ensemble cast of B-list celebs like _Diplodocus_ and _Camarasaurus_.

A new discovery published this month is extending the known range of one of the Morrison sauropod species, while also providing supporting evidence for an intriguing environmental hypothesis.

One Morrison Formation sauropod, _Barosaurus lentus_, is known from fossil finds across several states, including Wyoming, Utah, Oklahoma and South Dakota. Until now, _Barosaurus_ was not known to have lived in Montana, at the northern end of the Morrison Formation.

In an article this month in the 'New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 102', a team of four scientists published the details of a fossilized cervical vertebrae (neckbone) found in the Pryor Mountains of south-central Montana. The full article is [available for free online via ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/400050346_THE_FIRST_SPECIMEN_OF_BAROSAURUS_SAUROPODA_DIPLODOCIDAE_FROM_MONTANA_THE_NORTHERNMOST_OCCURRENCE_OF_THE_GENUS). 

The scientists - Cary Woodruff, Ph.D., curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Frost Science Museum, and Jason Schein, Katie Hunt and Skye Walker of the nonprofit [Elevation Science](https://elevationscience.org/) - provided a detailed analysis of the neckbone, which they identified as belonging to _Barosaurus_. 

## An ecological indicator?

Paleontologists generally group the sauropod species from the Morrison Formation into two families: the long, sleek, "diplodocids" which include _Diplodocus_, _Apatasaurus_ and _Barosaurus_, and the wide-nostril "macronarians" which include _Camarasaurus_ and _Brachiosaurus_ (you remember the sneezing _Brachiosaurus_ from 1993's _Jurassic Park_, don't you?). 

The team's discovery of _Barosaurus_ in Montana provides additional evidence for a hypothesis among some paleontologists that the northern end of the Morrison Formation may have been more ecologically favorable to the diplodocids than the macronarians. The authors stated in their paper that:

>While _Barosaurus_ is known from South Dakota and Wyoming, its absence in Montana has generally been perceived [...] as a sampling bias opposed to a true indication of the lack of this taxon from the regional Morrison ecosystem. However, as noted for the apparent rarity of the macronarian _Camarasaurus_ in Montana, the paucity of such taxa which are otherwise highly abundant elsewhere within the Morrison Formation could alternatively indicate slight ecological differences that were neither favorable nor preferred by certain taxa.

I was curious about this possible ecological distinction that favored the diplodocids. I reached out to Elevation Science, and received a response from Skye Walker, science communication manager for Elevation Science and one of the paper's co-authors.

"In the paper, we treat this as a __possible__ ecological signal rather than a definitive conclusion," Walker said. "The [identification] of _Barosaurus_ in Montana adds another data point to a broader pattern in the northern Morrison, where diplodocids seem to be more common than macronarians. But we do note that this pattern could reflect a combination of ecological differences, sampling bias or both!"
