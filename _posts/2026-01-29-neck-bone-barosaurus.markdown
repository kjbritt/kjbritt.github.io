The Morrison Formation is a sequence of sedimentary rock layers from the Upper (i.e. late) Jurassic Period, roughly 156 to 146 million years ago, found across much of the Western United States. The formation yielded up the fossilized bones of many iconic dinosaur species, including beloved _Stegosaurus_ and my personal favorite, _Allosaurus_. 

The Morrison Formation is notable for being home to _many_ species of sauropods - the herbivorous "long-neck" dinosaurs. The Morrison sauropods include dinosaur super-stars like _Brachiosaurus_ and _Apatosaurus_ (the artist formerly known as "Brontosaurus"), as well as an ensemble cast of B-list celebs like _Diplodocus_ and _Camarasaurus_. 

One Morrison Formation sauropod, _Barosaurus lentus_, is known from fossil finds across several states, including Wyoming, Utah, Oklahoma and South Dakota. Until now, _Barosaurus_ was not known to have lived in Montana, at the northern end of the Morrison Formation.

In an article this month in the 'New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 102', a team of four scientists published the details of a fossilized cervical vertebrae (neckbone) found in the Pryor Mountains of south-central Montana. The full article is [available for free online via ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/400050346_THE_FIRST_SPECIMEN_OF_BAROSAURUS_SAUROPODA_DIPLODOCIDAE_FROM_MONTANA_THE_NORTHERNMOST_OCCURRENCE_OF_THE_GENUS). 

The scientists - Cary Woodruff, Ph.D., curator of paleontology at the Frost Science Museum, and Jason Schein, Katie Hunt and Skye Walker of the nonprofit Elevation Science - provided a detailed analysis of the neckbone, which they identified as belonging to _Barosaurus_.

Skye Walker:
That's a fair interpretation! With the key caveat here being that in the paper, we treat this as a POSSIBLE ecological signal rather than a definitive conclusion.
The ID of Barosaurus in Montana adds another data point to a broader pattern in the northern Morrison, where diplodocids seem to be more common than macronarians. But we do note that this pattern could reflect a combination of ecological differences, sampling bias, or both!
