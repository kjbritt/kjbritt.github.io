Back in June I had the opportunity to cover an active archaeological excavation at the Carpenter Site near Delta Junction, Alaska as part of my work with the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA).

A co-worker and I spent two days as guests at the site, and I was able to interview and observe the instructor, students and volunteers as they worked. From this, I produced a three part series about the archaeology at the Carpenter Site:

## About the Carpenter Site

The Carpenter Site is located on a bluff near the mouth of the Shaw Creek, about a half-hour drive from the small community of Delta Junction, Alaska. The site is also known as “Naayii'ęę'” — a traditional place name for the area in the Middle Tanana Dene language, meaning “it is visible across.”  

For those interested in learning more about the pre-colonial history and archeaology of the region, I highly recommend reading [The Gift of the Middle Tanana](https://www.amazon.com/Gift-Middle-Tanana-Pre-Colonial-Interior/dp/179365476X) by Gerad Smith.
