Back in June I had the opportunity to cover an active archaeological excavation at the Carpenter Site near Delta Junction, Alaska as part of my work with the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA).

A co-worker and I spent two days as guests at the site, and I was able to interview and observe the instructor, students and volunteers as they worked. From this, I produced a three part series about the archaeology at the Carpenter Site:

1. [A left-handed stone tool?](https://www.uaa.alaska.edu/news/archive/2025/07/left-handed-stone-tool.cshtml)
1. [Ice Age cooking?](https://www.uaa.alaska.edu/news/archive/2025/09/ice-age-cooking-carpenter-site.cshtml)
