Three years ago, Alaska made national headlines for the ["Alaska high-altitude object" incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Alaska_high-altitude_object). On Feb. 10, 2023, the U.S. Air Force shot down the high-altitutde object over the Arctic Ocean, just off the coast from Deadhorse, Alaska. The downed object evidently disappeared into the Arctic Ocean, and the search for debris ended on Feb. 18. For a time, the media and everyday Alaskans discussed the incident as a potential unidentified flying object (UFO) of potential extraterrestrial origin, though the federal government ruled the object had been a man-made balloon. 

While things seem to have quieted down over the last two years, [a recent study by Canada Sports Betting (CSB)](https://www.canadasportsbetting.ca/news/research/alien-abduction-odds-2026/) suggests that Alaskans have a 1 in 77 odds of being abducted by aliens in 2026. In the their January report, <cite>Alien Abduction Odds Index 2026</cite>, CSB ranked each Canadian provence and US state in terms of reported alien abductions. 

## A fun tool for data exploration

[Ashton Harris](https://www.ashtonharris.me/), a UX software architect, designed a fascinating data visualization. 

I noticed that there seems to be a correlation in which states that rank highly on the list also border Canada. Seven of the top eight states on the list border Canada: New Hampshire, Idaho, Vermont, Maine, Montana and Wyoming. 

Alaska, at 14th in the list, outpaces 16th place Nevada, home to the infamous "Area 51".
