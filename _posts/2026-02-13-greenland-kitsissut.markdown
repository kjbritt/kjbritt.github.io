The world saw a number of important innovations 4,500 years ago. In the Nile Valley, ancient Egpytians constructed the pyramids at Giza. On the Salisbury Plain, Brittons erected Stonehenge. And in the Arctic, Paleo-Inuit people crossed treacherous waters on skin-on-frame boats to access remote islands off the coast of Greenland.

In a study published on Feb. 9 in the academic journal _Antiquity_, titled <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/voyage-to-kitsissut-a-new-perspective-on-early-paleoinuit-watercraft-and-maritime-lifeways-at-a-high-arctic-polynya/FF3C29CC19A0797123A43718E52D266B"><cite>Voyage to Kitsissut: a new perspective on Early Paleo-Inuit watercraft and maritime lifeways at a High Arctic polynya</cite></a>, lead author <a href="https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/matthew-walls">Matthew Walls</a>, Ph.D., from the University of Calgary reported on an archaeological survey of the remote Kitsissut island cluster. Walls was joined on the paper by co-authors Mari Kleist and Pauline Knudsen, also with Calgary. 

The Kitsissut Islands are located between Canada's Ellesmere Island (_Umimmattooq_) and the northwest coast of Greenland (_Kalaallit Nunaat_). During an archaeological survey in 2019, the team discovered a number of "Early Paleo-Inuit features" on Isbjørne Island, one of the Kitsissut Islands. These features included stone circle tent rings along with hearth features, similar in style to those seen at other Paleo-Inuit sites.

The survey team discovered a bird humerus (upper arm/wing bone) within one of the tent rings. The humerus was identified as belonging to a thick-billed murre (_Uria lomvia_), a species of seabird that nests in colonies on the islands. The bone was later radiocarbon dated, resulting in a calibrated age of 4,400–3,938 years. 

The calibrated carbon date from the wing bone and the style of the tent rings help place the archaeological sites on Isbjorne within the Early Paleo-Inuit period, which archaeologists place at 4,500–2,700 years ago. 

## Inferences on watercraft and subsistence strategies

The Kitsissut Islands are located within a polynya, which is an area of Arctic water that remains open and free from sea ice. This means that it would not have been possible for humans to travel to the islands over an ice-bridge. Early Paleo-Inuit travelers would have had to make the journey across the dangerous Arctic waters in a boat or kayak.
