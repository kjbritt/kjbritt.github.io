Oklahoma [Rep. Jacob Rosecrants](https://www.okhouse.gov/representatives/jacob-rosecrants), who represents House District 46 in the Oklahoma House of Representatives, recently proposed making the long-neck sauropod _Sauroposeidon_ the new state fossil of Oklahoma. 

"Why _Sauroposeidon proteles_? Because _Sauroposeidon_ is the tallest dinosaur yet discovered in the world, found in the Antlers formation, near Atoka, [Oklahoma] in 1994," Rosecrants [explained in a Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1286951409910192&set=a.287876143151062) on Jan. 31. "These fossils were so large that they were thought to be petrified logs at first!"

This proposal may face some controversy, though. Oklahoma already has an officially designated state fossil, _Saurophaganax_. As Rosecrants explained in his Facebook post:

>The _Saurophaganax_ fossil (found in the Morrison formation in the panhandle in the 1930s) was thought to be that of the largest meat-eating dino ever discovered, so an obvious choice for our state fossil. Recently, however, experts re-classified this species because it was found to be a chimera (the fossil was reconstructed with elements coming from more than a single species), essentially making _Saurophaganax_ a false species.

Oklahoma has a separate designation for official state dinosaur, currently held by the theropod _Acrocanthosaurus_. Fossil trackways created by _Sauroposeidon_ and _Acrocanthosaurus_ can be [visited at a state park](https://kjbritt.github.io/paleontology/2026/01/27/dinosaur-valley-tx.html) in neighboring Texas.

_Sauroposeidon_ is my favorite dinosaur!
