Early in my career as a web manager, I was often tasked with searching over websites manually checking for "broken links" (on-page hyperlinks that lead to interal or external 404 pages). As I sat scrolling, clicking, scrolling and clicking through web pages making sure each of the links worked, I often thought to myself "surely there's a more efficient way to do this?". 

Thankfully, I was also "learning to code" in Python at the time. I soon discovered that the Python programming language offers plenty of libraries that can help automate tasks like checking for broken 404 links on a website. 

With a few simple Python scripts that you can run from your own computer, you to can easily automate the hunt for broken links on the websites that you manage.
